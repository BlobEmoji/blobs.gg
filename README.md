# blobs.gg

The blobs.gg website.

## Getting Started

We use [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) to bundle application assets like
stylesheets, images, and scripts.

Make sure you have Node.js and `npm` installed before proceeding.

Install dependencies:

```sh
$ npm install
```

### Developing

Start the bundler:

```sh
$ npm start
```

A local HTTP server will start at http://localhost:1234. It will automatically
build the website and reload the page upon any changes.

## Building

Build the website:

```sh
$ npm run build
```

Static assets will be in `dist/`.
